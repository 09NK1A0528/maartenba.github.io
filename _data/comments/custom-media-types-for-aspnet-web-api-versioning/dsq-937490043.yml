message: '<p>Cool variant, however I am MEH on you putting it into the media type portion itself. Have you considered using the version property of the media type? I.e. Accept: application/foo; version=1.0</p><p>The advantage of this is not having to mint a new media type for each version, which you do not want to do.</p>'
