message: "<p>Hi Maarten<br>First of all congratulations on the production of a fantastic control, this truly seems like something that Microsoft should be made aware of for the next release of MVC as this solution meets the needs of the MVC developer far more aptly than the standard ASP.NET sitemapprovider.</p><p>However, In saying that it does not quite meet my needs and I was wondering if it would be possible to extend your control in the same way I have extended the standard sitemapprovider for <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> 2.0.</p><p>My requirement is to add custom attributes (such as userarea=\"*\" userlevel=\"*\") to the MVC.Sitemap so that I can test permissions based a custom session object that I create when a user logs into our site. In ASP.NET 2.0 I achieved this by and overriding the standard isAccessibleToUser method as in Alex Thissen's example <a href=\"http://www.alexthissen.nl/blogs/main/archive/2006/08/23/custom-security-trimming-in-asp-net-sitemaps.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.alexthissen.nl/blogs/main/archive/2006/08/23/custom-security-trimming-in-asp-net-sitemaps.aspx\">http://www.alexthissen.nl/b...</a>. I could use the same technique as before however with the MVC model being so different I think it would be a shame to have to modify my route map so that only one address maps to each controller as is being suggested by the ASP.NET article: <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/providing-website-navigation-with-sitemaps-vb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/providing-website-navigation-with-sitemaps-vb\">http://www.asp.net/mvc/tuto...</a></p><p>My vain attempt at trying to decipher your source was rather humbling. Any help would be most appreciated.</p><p>Regards<br>Gavin</p>"
