message: <p>Ok. I do have question on MVC and models. I want to build an multilingual website so i need to get the localized version of the objects from db. This is not a problem only there are multible objects like menuitems and person and footer etc.. How can i bind them to 1 view with modelbinder? What is best practise for it? Can i bind multiple models?</p>
