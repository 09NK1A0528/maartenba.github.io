message: "<p>Great information, however even after reading the other posts in the series, I still don't see that you have addressed the question of failover:</p><p>[quote]Only problem left is that we have a new single point of failure (SPOF): the ASP.NET state service. But we might just set up 2 of those and fail over both session service machines.[/quote]</p><p>The session service isn't cluster aware and even in your load balanced senerio, if a session service box goes down, you lose those sessions, right?</p><p>I have a hard time understanding whay anyone would use a single session service box in a web farm.  There seems to be only two reasons for a web farm: capacity and availablity.</p><p>If capacity is a concern, the session service actually added load to the box since it now has to make an external out of process call for sessions information.  If the concern is availablity, having several boxes in the farm would help - until you move all session information to this non-clusterable spof server.</p><p>Am I missing something or is there a way to handle failover for session state using a state server?</p>"
