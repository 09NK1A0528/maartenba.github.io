message: '<p>I have an old and failing Lumia 920 (now the charge port is getting flakey, and the battery is about shot, which is not a good combo).  I have been waiting for a new flagship phone for what feels like forever.  I have been thinking about going back to iPhone since they finally fixed my 3 big complaints: terrible keyboard, ugly skumorphism and way too small of a device.  (Android is a non-option; too low quality, no protection from bad apps in the store, I do not use google for anything other that search, and I will not use GPL code if there is a viable alternative)</p><p>MS needs to get the app thing sorted somehow.  It goes much deeper than just people not spending the time/money on the apps.  They app platform itself is a mess.  Silverlight for WinPhone (or its worse cousin Win8.1 universal apps) is just a bad copy of WPF, a tech most people cannot figure out very easily.  It is slow, goofy, way different (the xaml part) than any other framework, and very hard to debug or make performant.</p>'
