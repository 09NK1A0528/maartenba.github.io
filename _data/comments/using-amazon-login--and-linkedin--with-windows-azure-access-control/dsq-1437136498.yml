message: <p>Neat idea but getting to the site from NZ:</p><p>Error 404 - Web Site not found!</p><p>The website you have attempted to reach is not available in this Microsoft Azure Web Sites region. This could be due to one of several reasons:</p><p>                1. The web site owner has registered a custom domain to point to the Microsoft Azure Web Site, but has not yet configured Azure to recognize it. Click here to read more.</p><p>                        When a site owner wants to use a custom domain with a Microsoft Azure Web Sites website, Azure needs to be configured to recognize the custom domain name, so that it can route the request to the appropriate server in the region. After registering the domain with a domain provider and configuring a DNS CNAME record to point to the site's <a href="http://Azurewebsites.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Azurewebsites.net">Azurewebsites.net</a> address (for example, <a href="http://contoso.azurewebsites.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="contoso.azurewebsites.net">contoso.azurewebsites.net</a>), the website owner also needs to go to the Azure Portal and configure the site for the new domain.

The web site owner has moved the web site to a different region, but the DNS cache is still directing to the old IP Address that was used in the previous region. Click here to read more.</p>
