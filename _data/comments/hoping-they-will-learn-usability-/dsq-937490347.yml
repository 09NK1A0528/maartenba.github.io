message: <p>Hey Maarten,</p><p>You've nailed a very common point of frustration pretty good. Sites like Google, Skype, Monster and a lot more have a tendency of looking where your IP originates from and provide "custom" content in order to facilitate internet noobs. But unfortunately most of us aren't noobs and we expect that websites give us their content and stop trying to be "smart", because that's not the reason we visit them.</p><p>I hope that website's kill their "smart" stuff and just provide us the content we want, becoming a "good boy".</p><p>Happy new year and see you next year,</p><p>Michelangelo</p>
