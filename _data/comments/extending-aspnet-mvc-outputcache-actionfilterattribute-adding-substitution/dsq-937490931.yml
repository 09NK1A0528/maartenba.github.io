message: <p>Maarten, this is really good, and in some ways more useful than the official built-in [OutputCache] filter introduced in Preview 4.</p><p>However, I think there's a slight mistake! When you use OnRequestExecuting(), you should really be using OnActionExecuting() - otherwise you're running the action method every time, even when it's "cached". I tried you code, changing OnRequestExecuting() to OnActionExecuting(), and it works really well.</p><p>Nice one.</p>
