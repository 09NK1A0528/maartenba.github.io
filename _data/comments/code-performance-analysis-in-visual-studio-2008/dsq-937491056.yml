message: <p>Maarten -</p><p>Thank you for writing such an informative article.  As someone that uses SQL Profiler on a daily basis to look at the performance of SQL scripts, I wasn't aware of this functionality in 2008 and I am very glad to see it.  Thank you for making me aware of this feature!</p>
