message: <p>"All you need to build or run most of such projects is a node executable and an Internet connection to download dependencies on the fly"</p><p>In the proprietary software world, this is a problem. If it happens, Vendors have no control over how their software is distributed and how people pay for it. If everything was free to download things would be much easier. In reality, it isn't.</p><p>I don't think the problem can be solved, unless Microsoft take the lead and do it for their SDKs, like they took the lead on NuGet.</p>
