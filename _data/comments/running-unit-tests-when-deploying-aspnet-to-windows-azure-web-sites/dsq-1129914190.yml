message: <p>I'm doing more in depth research on some of the nuance of Windows Azure and keep finding myself coming back to this site, even when I google for something completely separate. Maybe I should ask now, is there anything you haven't done with Azure?</p><p>Also, would you recommend this approach of running unit tests before deployment or should you implement a TeamCity build server in Azure and let that handle the build and unit testing?</p>
