message: <p>Lots of great info here. But I have 2 questions:<br>1. How do you build the test dll? I don't see a custom script step and Azure doesn't seem to build the whole solution.<br>2. How did you know curl was available for use on the Azure webserver? I can't seem to find a list of supported commands.</p>
