message: "<p>Because DefaultBindig check this[string columnName] just after set the property, this approach don't let you validate one property based on another, because it coud be not initialized yet.</p><p>I Think was better to validate all the columnName when Error is called.</p><p>Another think: if DefaultBinding can&amp;#180t cast to destination type (ex.: unitPrice TextBox with \"Hello\"), IDataErrorInfo will never be called, so this way we can create our custom message for this kind of error.</p>"
