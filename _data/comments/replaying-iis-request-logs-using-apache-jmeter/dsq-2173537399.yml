message: <p>I like the 'gold master' testing approch, but I agree that replay testing using the IIS logs doesn't test very much - it assumes everything is a GET, there's no authentication, no state between calls, and you don't care about the response content. Using something else like Runscope or Fiddler would be more useful for validating behaviour.</p>
