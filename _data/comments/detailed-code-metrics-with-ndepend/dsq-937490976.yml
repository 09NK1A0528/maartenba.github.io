message: <p>Yes NDepend is a pretty neat tool - it shows you visually what you would otherwise have to do code reviews for.  I wrote about it on my site a while ago, and plan to be using it more heavily soon when I start refactoring one of my ASP.NET projects.  Although that will be AFTER I get some unit tests in place.</p>
