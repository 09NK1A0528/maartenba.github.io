message: <p>I would like to track user agents and user languages.</p><p>I saw this could be accomplished using the the <code>Tracker</code> object and with the <code>TrackPageView</code> extension method.</p><p>However, I was wondering if it it possible to accomplish this when registering <code>ActionTrackingAttribute</code> as a global action filter?<br>Since I would like to avoid cluttering my controller actions.</p>
