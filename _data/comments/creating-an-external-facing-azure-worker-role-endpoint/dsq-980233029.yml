message: <p>I did something similar but I get robots scanning the port and connecting to my socket. Using RDP, I tried to whitelist one specific IP address, but I am not really managing the load balancer, just the VM internal endpoint ... <br>For your example how can I only allow some friendly machines to connect to TCP port 1234?</p>
