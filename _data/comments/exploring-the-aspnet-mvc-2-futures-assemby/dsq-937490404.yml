message: <p>As Phil Haack says in another thread, calling it ViewState is misleading as it's actually serializing a part of the model back to business logic.</p><p>ViewState wasn't wrong, it was just a mess and hard to wield. The Serialize helper on the other hand is rather easy to deal with without getting out of hand.</p>
