message: <p>[quote]if (PerformanceCounterCategory.CounterExists("State Server Sessions Active", "ASP.NET", stateServer.ServerName))[/quote]</p><p>Isn't that an inherent check on whether the State Server is operating? Or will you error out entirely if the machinename reference leads to a server that is down?</p><p>If it works properly as is, then couldn't you include this check in the PartitionResolver class and handle appropriately if your session is pointing at a server that can no longer be found?</p>
