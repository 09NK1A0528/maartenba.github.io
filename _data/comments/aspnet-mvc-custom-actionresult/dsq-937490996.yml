message: <p>Just bumped up to this post via the MSDN forum and thought I add this footnote.<br>I've done basically the same thing on a medium scale web application, because I thought it was the right thing to do... until I noticed how long it took for my thumbnail (and other) images to render - there are about 600 hundred of them (times 3, they exist in three sizes) and rendered 16 at a time on a paged view.<br>I've plugged my previous IHttphandler implementation back in and the page load time went from about 2 seconds back to 'not noticeable'.<br>I still think that what you describe is conceptually better, but just not feasible in all circumstances. I guess the performance hit of resolving controllers and action methods, applying filters and executing the results is just to high for these kinds of requests. Let's hope that gets better in future releases.</p>
