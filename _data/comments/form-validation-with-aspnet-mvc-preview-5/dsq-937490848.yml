message: <p>Client side validation is possible, you have to look for a validation framework that uses attributes. These attributes can be inspected, and correct javascript can be written to the page based on them (such as required, compare, regex).</p><p>But you have to get the name of the form element coupled with the property of your model class somehow. Hopefully the modelbinder is capable of that.</p>
