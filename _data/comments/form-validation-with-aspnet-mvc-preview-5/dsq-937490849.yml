message: <p>I'm created an mvc project with the first beta release and automatically the AccountController had generated ModelState.AddModelError like your example. When I updated to preview 5 from codeplex, I could no longer access ModelState.AddModelError from System.web.mvc.dll....How come you don't seem to be having this issue? Am I missing something?</p>
