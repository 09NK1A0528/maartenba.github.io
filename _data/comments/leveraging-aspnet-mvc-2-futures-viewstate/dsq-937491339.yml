message: <p>I was expecting this question :-) Sure, you can easily use hidden fields to store id and/or timestamp, feel free to do so. You can also use a "PersonConcurrency" class containing only ID and Timestamp properties. The advantage of this one is that no once can tamper with data once you also encrypt and sign the "SMS". You can do this with the third parameter to Html.Serialize().</p>
