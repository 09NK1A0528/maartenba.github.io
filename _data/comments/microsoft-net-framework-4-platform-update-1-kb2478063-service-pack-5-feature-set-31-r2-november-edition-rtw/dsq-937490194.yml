message: '<p>You &amp;#39d better want to go there (the Java side, that is). No SPs, no "Platform Updates", no blabla-whatever: just a simple consistent versioning scheme.</p><p>As for the screenshot: that issue has been solved for over 2.5 years now (since Java 6 update 10), which can&amp;#39t be said about all the "Microsoft Visual C++ 20xx Redistributable ..." rubbish in that list (not to mention those entries have version numbers like 9.0.30729.4148...how clear is that? :P)</p>'
