message: "<p>Okay, fine: so you just told me the browser is irrelevant for Silverlight developers. I won't argue with that. For non-Silverlight web developers, IE is currently terrible and is slated to nearly-but-not-quite catch up to 2009 browsers by the end of 2010 or so. You still haven't made a case for why Internet Explorer is an important part of the \"three-screen\" future.</p>"
