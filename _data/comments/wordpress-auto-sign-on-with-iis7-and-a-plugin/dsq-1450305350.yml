message: <p>I can't seem to get the plugin to show up in the list to be activated.  I downloaded the updated version (for WP 3.1+) which is just the IISAUTH.PHP file.  I then created a plugin directory called iisauth and added the php file.  I also added Windows Authentication and restarted the server.  What am I missing?</p>
