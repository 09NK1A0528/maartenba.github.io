message: <p>OK, I forgot about the lower case file name.  Now it's activated.  But it's not working.  I still find myself needing to log in, even after disabling anonymous in IIS and adding/enabling Windows authentication.  I also added wpDirAuth for LDAP login so I could add myself as a user.  So what am I missing this time?<br>Using 2008 R2 64 bit, WP 3.9.1, IIS 7</p>
