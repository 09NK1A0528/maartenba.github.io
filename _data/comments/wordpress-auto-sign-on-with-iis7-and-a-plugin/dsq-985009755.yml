message: <p>Okay, that worked great. This plugin is fantastic. Last question (I hope). For some reason, some of our employees are being prompted to enter in their credentials in order to connect to the WP site where others are automatically logged in. I can't seem to pinpoint the problem. Any suggestions?</p>
