message: <p>We have installed your plugin and it works very well! The only issue we would like to fix is being able to assign specific users to wordpress roles on first login when the account is created. At the moment it assigns everyone as a subscriber, is it possible to customise this? Also, it would be great if it populated the users firstname &amp; lastname in wordpress with the users active directory first &amp; last name instead of the username. We need support for multiple browsers as well.</p><p>Unfortunately I'm not a coder, is there any chance getting your services? <br>Many thanks!</p>
