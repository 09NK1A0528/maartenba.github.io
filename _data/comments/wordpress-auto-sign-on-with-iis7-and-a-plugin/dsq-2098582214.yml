message: <p>Hi Maarten !<br>Still having the same problems Wayne had!<br>I can't seem to get the plugin to show up in the list to be activated. I downloaded the updated version (for WP 3.1+) which is just the IISAUTH.PHP file.  I then created a plugin directory called iisauth and added the php file and renamed it to iisauth.php. But it just won't show up to be activated. What am I doing wrong ?<br>The WP is actually 4.2.2 ...</p>
