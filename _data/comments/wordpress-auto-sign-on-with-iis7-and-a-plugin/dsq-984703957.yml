message: "<p>Once this plugin is activated, can you still manage users' roles and capabilities through the WP Dashboard? My goal is to give certain users access to pages while restricting the rest of the users to these pages. Note: I currently accomplish this task through a plugin (I believe it's called User Access Management).</p>"
