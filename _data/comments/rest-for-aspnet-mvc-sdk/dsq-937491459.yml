message: <p>Maarten, thanks for pointing me in the right direction! I was not aware that the factories can be chained this way!<br>But from my point of view it feels a bit strange to have a controller factory which is not really creating the controller, it only adds behavior to the controller created by the default controller factory. A nicer approach could be to use extension points in the factory to modify the controller after creation. Wouldn't it be a better SoC?</p>
