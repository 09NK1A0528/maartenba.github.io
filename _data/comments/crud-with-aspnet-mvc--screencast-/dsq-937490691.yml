message: "<p>That's an interesting study into achieving CRUD with ASP.Net.  We've been working on the Habanero framework, which has a lot more focus on the UI layer, pulling it out to fourth normal form.</p><p>I was involved with an ASP project recently, enduring the pain of having to do C, R, U and D.  Habanero is working towards runtime user interface generation, providing controls that manage all the standard CRUD work for you, working from a very simple mapping definition.  Our effort so far has been focused on WinForms and Visual WebGui (an AJAX framework), so a pure ASP application would not benefit as much in the area of UI generation.  If you take the VWG approach, however, you're generating similar capability in less than 15 minutes.  Also, the change management is so much better, since you're not hard-coding TH and TD fields like you're doing here.  The last consideration obviously is that an AJAX framework works so much more efficiently with the heavy dataloads that are typical of CRUD.</p><p>The Habanero process is: reverse engineer your model layer from the database, generate a working n-tier application, generate a form built of runtime-generated UI components.  You get all the CRUD for free and you get an OO domain layer ready for custom logic.</p>"
