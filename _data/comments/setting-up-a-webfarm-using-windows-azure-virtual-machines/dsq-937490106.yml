message: '<p>Thanks, very well written post!</p><p>There&amp;#39s one thing I&amp;#39m wondering though: Given that the second machine has the same hostname and the same public IP as the first machine, how can we deploy anything into the second machine? I think that there must be some obvious answer to this but I haven&amp;#39t figured it out yet :)</p><p>Best regards,<br>Mikael</p>'
