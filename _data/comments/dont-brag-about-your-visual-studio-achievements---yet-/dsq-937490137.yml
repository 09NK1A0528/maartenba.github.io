message: '<p>Maarten,</p><p>I agree. My first sentiment was &amp;#39I want the CleanCoder achievement&amp;#39. Gamification does work with certain people to just go a bit further.<br>But then I had a look at the actual achievements and was really disappointed. The ones in the post are the ones where you should get -100 points for: &amp;#39Regional Manager&amp;#39, &amp;#39Interrupting Cow&amp;#39, &amp;#39Turtles all the way down&amp;#39, &amp;#39Magic Numbers&amp;#39, &amp;#39Equal Opportunist&amp;#39, &amp;#39Overload&amp;#39</p><p>Achievements also seem to be targeted at &amp;#39old-school&amp;#39 programming styles. We all know VS is not TDD ready (there is no single TDD kata video out there using only VS2010! I even challenged Eric Mignot to do one... he kindly declined)</p><p>Indeed Jonas&amp;#39s Strokes project seems to be the one MS should have &amp;#39sponsored&amp;#39 instead of building their own.</p><p>There could indeed be achievements for using keyboard shortcuts, following SOLID principles, adhering to .NET conventions like correctly implement IDisposable, ...</p><p>So many positive achievements to be had. It&amp;#39s in Beta, so let&amp;#39s hope the RTM can bring a better message.</p>'
