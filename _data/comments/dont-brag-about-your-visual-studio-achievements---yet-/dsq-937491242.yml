message: <p>Hi Dan,</p><p>Hope you didn&amp;#39t take my post as an offence. I really really like the achievements, it&amp;#39s just that I would like to see a more clear indication that some achievements are negative.</p><p>To be constructive, here are some more positive ones:<br>- Pitcher! - Correctly rethrow an Exception<br>- Refactor an inherited class into composition<br>- Cloudy! Create a Windows Azure project<br>- Code dojo - Write more than 300 lines of code in various classes that compile the first time<br>- Build a thread-safe singleton<br>- Create a snippet for &lt;insert common code that the user types&gt;<br>- ...</p><p>Maybe even challenges can be fun:<br>- Implement the traveling salesman algoryhtm in LINQ<br>- Create a NuGet package<br>- ...</p><p>Best regards,<br>Maarten</p>
