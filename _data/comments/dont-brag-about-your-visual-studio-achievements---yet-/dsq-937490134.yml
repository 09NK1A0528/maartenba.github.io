message: <p>Hi Maarten,<br>Thanks for the feedback, suggestions now, while we&amp;#39re in beta, are great. If you have specific ideas for achievements, like we said in the post, suggest them in the Q&amp;A section. The majority of the achievements are positive achievements and in the description we include documentation about the features, like UML, that are underutilized in Visual Studio. We chose to have a few zero-point achievements to point out things that developers shouldn&amp;#39t be doing with the idea that if someone doesn&amp;#39t know how to fix code we can help them refactor code. As for other achievements, there&amp;#39s a lot of things we can do, I could easily imagine 10 achievements just around unit tests, another 20 for Azure, another 20 for TFS, and so on. <br>Cheers,<br>-Dan</p>
