message: '<p>This isn&amp;#39t apparent from your post, so&amp;#39ll ask to clarify: if I log into MyGet with Windows Live ID, what is my username to log into SymbolSource? Is it the same as "Username (used for authenticating against private feeds from a NuGet client)"? Perhaps you could change the label to also mention SymbolSource?</p>'
