message: <p>I agree, Stoyan. In fact, my non-OOP implementation (double implementation, actually - a Map class) currently uses two strings $keyValidation and $valueValidation, which get sent to eval() in validateKey() and validateValue(). My next task is to convert this to an interface (and consolidate my two validation functions into one).</p><p>P.S. I like your live preview; that's not something I had thought of using JavaScript for.</p>
