message: '<p>Excellent idea and nice way done. I really enjoyed learning this.But there is still an issue for me: I want to use aspx page as partial view in MVC 4. If i do that, I have to inherit it from "System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage&lt;dynamic&gt;" and I can not use the code behind (.cs) file. The real purpose to implement Grid View in MVC dies for me. can u suggest something for this problem ???</p>'
