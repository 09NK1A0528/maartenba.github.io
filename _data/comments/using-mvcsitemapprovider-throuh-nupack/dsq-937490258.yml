message: <p>Hey Maarten,</p><p>This looks great indeed. I have been using MvcSiteMapProvider since it was first brought onto codeplex, and have loved the new 2.0 features in some newer projects. This will make it even easier to put into my future work.</p><p>Also, trying not to add fuel to the NuPack fire, but it's disappointing that we are forced to add a "disclaimer for some" as a preemptive defense against would-be vocal members of the community bringing the NuPack war here... Ah well</p><p>-Matt</p>
