message: <p>Good article and good suggestions you are making. However, would you risk it using it for production environments? I'm afraid it will be offline for x hours, only to be hearing from Microsoft it wasn't production ready in the first place. Although unlikely, it may happen (e.g. for scheduled maintenance).</p>
