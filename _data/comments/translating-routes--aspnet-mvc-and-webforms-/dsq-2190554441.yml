message: <p>My question wsn't clear, I'm sorry for that. What I struggle with is that I cant figure out how to wire things up. My controller is named ProductController and I have an action named IndexByCategoryName with a categoryName parameter. How would I setup this with your library to support actions with parameters that can be localized?</p>
