message: <p>Great stuff Maarten and thanks for that! However, I have a hard time making it further with this case:</p><p>Let's say my website has products on it and it's in french canadian, canadian english and us english (for the currency symbols, etc...)  Take these links for example:</p><p><a href="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/footwear/sports-shoes" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/footwear/sports-shoes">http://mylocalizedwebsite.c...</a></p><p><a href="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/footwear/casual-shoes" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/footwear/casual-shoes">http://mylocalizedwebsite.c...</a></p><p><a href="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/outdoor/paddles" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mylocalizedwebsite.com/en-ca/products/outdoor/paddles">http://mylocalizedwebsite.c...</a></p><p>Let's say I have like 20 000 possible urls cominations like that to localize using your library, how would I achieve that?</p><p>My guess is I have to read all my localized values from our database and generate TranslatedRoutes that I add to my routing table at the very start of the app which I do already but I'm stumped on how to wire things up with your solution.</p><p>Thanks!</p>
