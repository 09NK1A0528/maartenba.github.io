message: <p>Thanks for this post!<br>I have a question, in my project I have a route <a href="http://www.example.com/search" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.example.com/search">www.example.com/search</a> which I mapped to /Home/Search:<br>routes.MapRoute("SearchRoute", "search", new { controller = "Home", action = "Search" });<br>Is there a way to translate the url (in this case 'search')? Or do I have to create another route with the translated url?</p>
