message: <p>Very nice use of the SignalR framework. <br>As the framework gets popular I see more innovative uses of it. This is definitely up there. <br>Sometime back I had blogged about how to use it for Collaborative editing using the diff-match-patch algo and SignalR.<br>Good job with the presentation demo. Now we need a spreadsheet implementation, combine them all and offer alternative to Office/Google docs online ;-)...<br>Cheers,<br>Sumit.</p>
