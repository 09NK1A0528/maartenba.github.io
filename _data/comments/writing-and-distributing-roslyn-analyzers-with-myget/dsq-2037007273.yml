message: '<p>If you write System.DateTime.Now the analyzer crashes due to an invalid cast. Is there a way to know that the "Now" identifier is a property on the type System.DateTime no matter if you write DateTime or System.DateTime?<br>It seems wrong to have to handle these two scenarios separately.<br>Further: We really only want to apply the fix if the type is System.DateTime and not SomeOtherNamespace.DateTime.</p><p>What to do?</p>'
