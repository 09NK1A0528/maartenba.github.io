message: "<p>Yeah, imagine if you could do SQL Server log-shipping from a local live SQL Server instance to SQL Azure. That way you're not more than one transaction log backup away from doing a 'failover' to the cloud. The switch would then be: make local db readonly, backup tx log, ship, make azure live...  And then the same thing in the opposite direction when going from Azure back to a local server.</p>"
