message: <p>Extremely useful, I've downloaded the full set including xls and xlsx... the information on Chart substreams and pivot tables looks particularly useful.<br>But it's a lot of wading through external to figure things out.... and there's still gaps. I'm trying to identify exactly how external functions are referenced.</p>
