message: <p>A nice find Maarten - what would be interesting to know is how a Model of List&lt;dynamic&gt; - that consists of editable fields can be processed by the Post Action (and understand what each of the indivdual Sections it contain map to for persitence). I am presuming that the type of the Model passed back to the Action is also List&lt;dynamic&gt; ...?</p><p>I tried a very simple test that posted back from a UI rendered from List&lt;dynamic&gt; and the data is indeed posted, but is not reconstructed back into the List&lt;dynamic&gt;, as obviously it does not know what to recompose...</p>
