message: <p>@Miha, there are already JsonResult and PartialViewResult in MVC (your commented sounded like we would need to build them).<br>One good thing with Maarten's approach is that you can make any existing action available via Ajax just by slapping that attribute on it. If we were to use a PartialViewResult, then we would have to check if this was an Ajax call or regular request in every one of those actions.<br>I like this.</p>
