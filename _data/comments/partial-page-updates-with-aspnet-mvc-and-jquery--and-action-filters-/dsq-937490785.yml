message: "<p>@Sergio: sure. It is a philosophical debate at this point. I mean, there is more than one way to do it, obviously. It is more a matter of taste what seems more 'right'. One could also argue, that partial result is a different kind of view -- in this simple case, where you simply replace it with an empty master layout, it works... All in all, it's a solution to a problem -- and that's what counts at the end of the day. :)<br>@Maarten: in the mean time, I have check out Pure, and I like it. It's a fresh approach to client-side templating.</p>"
