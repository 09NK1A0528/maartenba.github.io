message: <p>I don't know if anyone else has this problem. When I shut down the server and I start it again it doesn't matter what value has the cron, the task is executed always (and I've the schedule to execute it once per month. Schedule =&gt; "0 0 1 * *").<br>Does anyone know what I'm missing?</p>
