message: <p>Hi Maarten,</p><p>First of all, the code is looking slick, thanks!</p><p>For some reason I can't get it to work and I'm afraid I'm missing out on something simple. I've implemented it the same way as you did (using your sample code), but my SchedulerHostedService is never being created on application startup.</p><p>Is this something I have to do manually somewhere?</p>
