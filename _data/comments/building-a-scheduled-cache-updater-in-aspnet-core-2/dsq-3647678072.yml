message: <p>Yes, that works. After comparing code I found out that it's the IHostedService interface that was causing issues. In my hurry I created my own IHostedService interface, but the trick is to use the one provided in the Microsoft Extensions. Thanks! I'm tweaking it a bit to run the check if a task needs to run every full minute (06:01:00 and 06:02:00 etc), but other than that it works perfectly.</p>
