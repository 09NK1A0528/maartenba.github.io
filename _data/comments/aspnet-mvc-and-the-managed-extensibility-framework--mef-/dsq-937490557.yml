message: <p>very cool, I like it alot.  I have been working on somthing like this,  it helps alot.  Is it possible to say be able to update these "plug-ins" on the fly.  So from my app a can download a new version from some sort of online repository and have it overwrit the one in the plugin directory.  It was always a problem with like assembly.load and what not.  but i am not sure if mef resolves this.</p>
