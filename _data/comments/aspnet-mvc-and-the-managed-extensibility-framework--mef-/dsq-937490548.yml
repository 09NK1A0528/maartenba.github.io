message: <p>MEF looks very promising.  It seems that extensibility is something that we are all trying to achieve.  I love the article but find myself wanting more...  How does this work in say a standard ASP.Net environment or say you have a web site using Web parts.   How could you add or remove these web parts or widgets dynamically.</p>
