message: '<p>Hi, awesome work! Thanks for sharing it. Just a note: your implementation of ReleaseController should call container.ReleaseExport( controllerExport ) instead. This way MEF can release references and dispose any nonshared/disposable part in the graph that the controller started.</p><p>I will publish a sample on MEF/MVC this week that shows how to do that. Stay tuned :-)</p><p>Thanks</p>'
