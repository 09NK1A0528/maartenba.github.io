message: "<p>Following your advice, I had a quick read through the sample chapter 6. Whilst the content in general is good, it has many rough edges which your review didn't mention:</p><p>Explanations are often cumbersome, wordy and repetitive. For example, \"Our Invoice class is implementing two distinct tasks: managing invoice state and generating a readable invoice. The data required to generate a readable invoice (over and above the data shown on an invoice) isn't used by Invoice when not generating a readable invoice. Our Invoice class can be said to have multiple responsibilities: the responsibility of managing state and the responsibility of generating a readable invoice.\"</p><p>So while he advocates SRP, he obviously ignores DRY... joking ;-))</p><p>My quick cursory reading noted several typos.</p><p>The example of using an event to reduce coupling (p180) uses a whacky non-standard event implementation.</p><p>I mention these issues because they're a sign of inadequate proof-reading and weak technical editing. More work required! Perhaps they'll sort it out for the 2nd edition?</p>"
