message: <p>Interesting post. I blogged on a similar topic recently, albeit with a slightly different approach.</p><p><a href="http://www.stevehollis.com/2010/04/trait-like-functionality-for-php/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.stevehollis.com/2010/04/trait-like-functionality-for-php/">http://www.stevehollis.com/...</a></p><p>It still uses reflection and the __call magic method, but employs a broker to add specific functionality to objects.</p><p>Ralph's points on performance are all clearly valid, but I wonder how significant they might be in a real life app compared to say, too many or poorly optimised DB queries, remote calls, excessive file system access, lack of caching etc. etc. Presumably we're only talking about milliseconds even for hundreds of magic method and reflection calls.</p><p>Regarding best practices, what about DRY? The approach that both Maarten and I have blogged about address an un-addressed problem in PHP... a means of so-called "horizontal" re-use. There are other approaches such as code generation that are "code completion friendly", but surely they offer a means of making code duplication easier rather than eliminating.</p>
