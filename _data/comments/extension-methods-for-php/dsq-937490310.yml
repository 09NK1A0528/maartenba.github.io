message: <p>The sample code coincides with something I do myself (as a sort of hackish way of getting some of Ruby's module benefits in certain scenarios - not many of those since I restrict it to times when I just have to be able to throw methods at a class without actually editing it too much). There are performance hits, but it really depends on where they're used, how often, and whether you can optimise a bit. One optimisation, that's obvious, is from relying on get_declared_classes(). Is it possible to be more specific about classes to reflect? For example, use a specific namespace or a class prefix - then filter the results just for those types of classes. That would cut the potential 1000s of class lookups down to a minimal count.</p>
