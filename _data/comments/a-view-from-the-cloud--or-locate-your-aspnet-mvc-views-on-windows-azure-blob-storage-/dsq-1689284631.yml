message: <p>Yes now it works, it was the order in which the events were called. All I had to do is, move the "routes.MapRoute" before the default one. But now I am stuck with a blank rendered view. The "System.IO.Stream Open()" brings back view from blob successfully, however this is not rendered.</p>
