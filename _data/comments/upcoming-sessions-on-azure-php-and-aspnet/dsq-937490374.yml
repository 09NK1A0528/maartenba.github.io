message: <p>Hi Maarten,</p><p>can you tell me something more about  Azure pricing? How about the computing time thing? Is that every single second my projects are online or just the seconds my projects require CPU?  Suppose I have a website online for a full month but is never visited. Will I be charged a lot?</p>
