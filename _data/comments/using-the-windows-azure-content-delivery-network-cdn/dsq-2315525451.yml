message: <p>Great article,<br>But somewhere something is not working. I feel like an idiot, but, I ask anyway :)<br>The code works, all my files are on the storage blob container. The CDN links to the blob container, but when I try to use the cdn css files, they cannot be found. Any idea/thoughts would help me.<br>Sorry for spelling mistakes, English is not my native language,</p>
