message: <p>Hi,<br>very nice article indeed.</p><p>I have two questions.<br>First of all, how could you implement multilanguage support on your site map provider? For a site that uses ..\&lt;Language&gt;-&lt;Locale&gt;\... for url routing, how could this be reflected on the site map?<br>Finally, how could you create a sitemap for posting it on Google, Yahoo, etc... search engines?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>
