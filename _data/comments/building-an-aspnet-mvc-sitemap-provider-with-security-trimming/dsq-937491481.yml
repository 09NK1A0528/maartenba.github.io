message: <p>Thanks maartenba. I know "there are multiple nodes in the sitemap which are generating the same URL."<br>But i don't know why i use &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="Manage" controller="Products" action="Index" /&gt; --&gt; it always generate url is /root instead of /root/controller/action because i declare controller is Products and action is Index. I want to use index in my sitemap with several controller.</p>
