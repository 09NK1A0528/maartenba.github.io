message: <p>Great article but im wondering if it is possible to use a drop down menu i created instead of that asp:menu? I was told to avoid tables unless its a grid or something similar and i really would like to do the menu this way but im not sure on how to create my own menu that takes a datasource like this. Any suggestions?</p>
