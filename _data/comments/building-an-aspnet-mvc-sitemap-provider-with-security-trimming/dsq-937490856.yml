message: "<p>Hey Maarten,</p><p>First, great work on this one.  It's a straight forward example of implementing a sitemap provider.</p><p>Second, I just wanted to let you know that I have encountered a bit of a problem in using your code with Preview 5, and more specifically the AcceptAction attribute on action methods.  When the MvcSiteMapProvider gets to around line 227 and tries this:</p><p>object[] actionAttributes = controller.GetType().GetMethod(mvcNode.Action).GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorizeAttribute), true);</p><p>It borks with the following message: \"Ambiguous match found.\"   I'm not familiar enough with mvc yet to fix this, but I am thinking it's becuase I have two actions of the same name in my controller class, each with a different signature and tagged with different AcceptVerbs attributes.</p>"
