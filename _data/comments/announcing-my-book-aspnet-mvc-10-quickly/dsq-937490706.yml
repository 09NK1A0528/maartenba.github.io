message: <p>Cool article! I'm a little bit sad about developing C# WinForms/WPF all day long, but I'll recommend your book to my asp addicted colleagues ;-).<br>I've one questition, because I'm writing a diploma thesis with MS Word 2007... Did you save your documents as XML files? So that you may use diff and other tools?! Or was your intention only to have a clear history and backup?</p>
