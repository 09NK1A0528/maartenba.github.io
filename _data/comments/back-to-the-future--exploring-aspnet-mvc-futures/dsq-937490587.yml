message: <p>Excellent. The MVC Futures assembly has some nice features that look promising. However, before looking into the future "they" (MVC team) should definitely start writing more articles, i.e. documentation, for the current release to start winning MVC souls. And, like you mentioned, fully implement the MVC Controls (yes, you need them!). ;)</p>
