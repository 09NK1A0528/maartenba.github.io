message: <p>There is now actually a way to do this for free, if you have IIS 7.0. I wrote a small tutorial in my blog:</p><p><a href="http://blog.qiui.com/index.php/2008/08/03/zend-framework-in-iis7-with-url-rewrite-module/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.qiui.com/index.php/2008/08/03/zend-framework-in-iis7-with-url-rewrite-module/">http://blog.qiui.com/index....</a></p><p>Hope this helps some people. I had to figure this out by myself as the module if pretty new :)</p>
