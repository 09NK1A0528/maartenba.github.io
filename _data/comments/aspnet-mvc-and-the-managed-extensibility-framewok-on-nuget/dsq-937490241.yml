message: <p>No. I want to do just a regular object and I dont want to do it by convention. I just want to add that object in like the above. container.ComposeExportedValue&lt;ISomeObject&gt;(new SomeObject()); before the first controller is instantiated so that it can import in the ISomeObject. I havent found a place I can do this and it works yet.</p>
