message: <p>What type of export do you want to add? Controllers? Controller exports are registered by convention over at AppStart_MefContribMVC3.Start() in the new ConventionCatalog(new MvcApplicationRegistry()). Check the MefContrib sources if you want to do something similar with other classes.</p>
