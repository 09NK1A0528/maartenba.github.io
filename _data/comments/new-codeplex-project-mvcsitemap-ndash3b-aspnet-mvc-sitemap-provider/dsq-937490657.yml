message: "<p>Repeating Alberto's request for a feature \"At your Helper Menu, a property to specify the starting node level (ex.: for a 2&amp;#186 level left menu)\"</p><p>This would be a really good feature since many menus are designed in that fashion. So if you could find the time to add that feature it would be awesome :-)</p>"
