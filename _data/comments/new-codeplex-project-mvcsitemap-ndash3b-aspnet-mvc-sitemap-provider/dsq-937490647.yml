message: <p>Hi, Maarten, nice job! However, i&amp;#180m still not able to use localization as it is stated in msdn. I enabled localization in the sitemap file, added resourcekeys in every sitemap node and also created the resource file Web.sitemap.resx file in my App_GlobalResources folder. Am i doing something wrong? Can you post working example with localization enabled?? <br>Regards,<br>Germ&amp;#225n</p>
