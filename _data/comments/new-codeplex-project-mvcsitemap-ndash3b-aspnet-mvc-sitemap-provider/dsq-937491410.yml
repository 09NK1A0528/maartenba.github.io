message: <p>fyi, I just checked out the latest source code (Change Set 54379) and only found this option in MvcSiteMap v1.0. So is this option depreciated? If it is it's a damn shame because it's extremely convenient. So I guess I have to create my own class implementing IDynamicNodeProvider in order to get parameters to show up in the breadcrumbs????</p>
