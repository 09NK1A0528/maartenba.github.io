message: <p>hey maarten, this MVC Sitemap provider is fantastic, thank you!</p><p>fyi, I downloaded build 23592; it seems to still have a bug where setting SiteTitle is lost. I patched this (temporarily, hopefully) by adding an override to the Title property in your MvcSiteMapNode class. <br>I'll check back for updates. Many thanks again.</p>
