message: <p>Hi Maarten, I am having difficulty getting your code to work, as I believe some methods you're using no longer exist, or have otherwise changed.  Do you have an updated version of this concept?</p><p>In the middleware example, 'context.SetFeature' (line 31) doesn't want tor resolve for me.  In the first example, '_matcher.Match(requestHost);' (line 12) doesn't work because the method now expects a PathString, which does not include (and therefore cannot match) the host.</p>
