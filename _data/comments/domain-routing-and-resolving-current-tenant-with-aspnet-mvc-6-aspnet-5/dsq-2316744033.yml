message: <p>That's what I already use (albeit modified), but I am still not entirely pleased of the way it looks. The code in this post just looks so much more mature and integrated into the framework, and I was wondering if there is such a thing as middleware in MVC5? I am not sure where to incorporate it into.</p>
