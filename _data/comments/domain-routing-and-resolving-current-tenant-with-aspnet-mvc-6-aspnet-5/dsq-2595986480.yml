message: <p>Thank you for sharing. I'd just like to point out that the first approach no longer works in RC1. This is due to a change in the TemplateMatcher class, which now expects a PathString to be passed to the Match method (instead of a string in a couple of versions ago). As a result of this change, I believe we're no longer able to use the default TemplateMatcher in this kind of application.</p>
