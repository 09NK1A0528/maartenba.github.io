message: <p>Great Post! It works very well with my project.</p><p>Just one little problem though. I have a Word document. The document contains two paragraphs and an image . The image is placed between the two paragraphs. In the WordVisualizer display. The text of the second paragraph was shown on the right hand side of the image indtea of being underneath it.</p><p>Is there any way I can fix this?</p>
