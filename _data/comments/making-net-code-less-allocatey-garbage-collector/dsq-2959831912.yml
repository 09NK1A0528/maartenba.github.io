message: <p>"Another way of preventing objects from moving into further heap generations is by making use of IDisposable"</p><p>Due to the way IDisposable works this is actually wrong. Using IDisposable guarantees that an object will live for one further generation than it would normally due to the way it is implemented. When the GC comes along and finds an object that's ready to collect with IDisposable it moves it into the finalizer queue (and thus get promoted a generation). It will then (maybe) get run asynchronously, and the GC will be able to clear it up on the next pass of that generation</p>
