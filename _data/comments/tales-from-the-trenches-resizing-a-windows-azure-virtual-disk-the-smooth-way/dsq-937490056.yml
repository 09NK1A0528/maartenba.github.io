message: <p>You are so seriously awesome for posting this, it really saved me.  I can&amp;#39t imagine why MS would think it reasonable to default the C drive to 30 gigs when Windows takes up 20+ gigs out of the box... so stupid.  I wonder how many fire drills this has caused... Well anyways I owe you a beer if you&amp;#39re ever in South OC!</p><p>Cheers!</p>
