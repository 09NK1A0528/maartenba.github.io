message: <p>Maarten, it also worked on the "hot" system perfectly.Many thanks - saved me a lot of time.<br>Do you think it is also possible to write a tool that resets e.g. the RDP port (3389) ? Sometimes it happens that you exclude yourself blocking this port and then you cannot access the VM again. The standard procedure is the same as for "resizing OS disk" - shut down and delete VM, delete disk, download disk, re-configure vhd using a vm tool, etc.  ...</p>
